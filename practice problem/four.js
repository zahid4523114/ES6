//Difference between Function Declaration and Function Expression:

//Function Declaration
//1.A function declaration must have a function name.

//2.Function declaration does not require a variable assignment.

//3.These are executed before any other code.

//4.The function in function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.

//5.Function declarations are hoisted.

//6.Syntax:
//function geeksforGeeks(paramA, paramB) {
// Set of statements
//}

//Function Expression
//1.A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.

//2.Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.

//3.Function expressions load and execute only when the program interpreter reaches the line of code.

//4.The function in function declaration can be accessed only after the function definition.

//5.Function expressions are not hoisted.

//6.Syntax:
//var geeksforGeeks= function(paramA, paramB) {
// Set of statements
//}
